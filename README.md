##  About Me

I am a passionate and results-driven Computer Science undergraduate with a strong foundation in software engineering, DevOps practices, and modern development workflows. With over 2 years of hands-on experience in **full-stack development**, **DevOps engineering**, and managing **e-commerce platforms**, I thrive in dynamic environments that challenge my ability to build scalable, secure, and maintainable systems.

Currently, I'm expanding my skill set into **Data Science** and **Cloud Computing**, exploring the intersection of intelligent analytics and high-performance infrastructure.
